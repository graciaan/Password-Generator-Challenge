# Password-Generator-Challenge
Welcome to the README of the Password-Generator-Challenge!
This website can be found at https://graciaan.github.io/Password-Generator-Challenge/
The purpose of this website is to provide a way to randomly generate a password using specific inputs from the user.
The first step is to choose how many digits the length of the password needs to be. The length must be between 8 and 128 digits.
Once this has been chosen, the user will be asked if they want to include Numbers, Capital Letters, Lower-Case Letters, and/or Special Characters.
The user must type "yes" or "no" for each of these questions in order for the Random Password Generator to accept their responses.
Once all of the choices have been recorded, the site will display the newly created random password.
